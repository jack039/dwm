'''Problem Statement

The Logistics and Supply Chain Management (LSCM) system plays a crucial role in 
ensuring that goods move efficiently from suppliers to customers through a network
 of warehouses and transportation channels. Efficient management of this process is 
 vital for maintaining product availability, customer satisfaction, and profitability. 
 However, organizations often face major challenges such as shipment delays, inaccurate 
 demand forecasting, supplier inefficiencies, warehouse overstock or understock situations, 
 and high transportation costs.

To address these issues, a data warehouse is proposed that integrates data from multiple
 operational systems — such as sales, purchase, shipment, and inventory management systems 
  — into a unified analytical repository. This integrated data warehouse will support 
  decision-making by providing a consolidated view of the entire supply chain.

The LSCM data warehouse will allow managers and analysts to perform multi-dimensional 
analysis on key performance parameters, including delivery time, transportation cost, 
supplier reliability, warehouse efficiency, and customer satisfaction. By organizing data 
into fact and dimension tables, the warehouse will enable efficient querying, reporting,
 and visualization of trends and performance metrics.

With the help of OLAP operations such as roll-up, drill-down, slice, and dice, decision
-makers can analyze data from different perspectives — for example, by region, time period, 
supplier, or product category.

This warehouse can help answer crucial business questions such as:

What is the total number of shipments delivered per region or time period?

What is the average delivery time per supplier or product category?

How much transportation cost is incurred for each route or region?

What are the inventory stock levels over time across different warehouses?

Which suppliers contribute most to delayed or on-time deliveries?

By implementing this data warehouse, organizations can achieve better visibility,
 performance tracking, and data-driven decision-making across the entire supply chain
 , ultimately improving efficiency, reducing costs, and increasing customer satisfaction'''
